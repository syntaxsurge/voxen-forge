## Feature highlights 🌟

- **Zero-friction wallet** – Phantom, Solflare and Ledger auto-connect.
- **OKX DEX API** – deep liquidity, signed requests and automatic rate-limit handling.
- **Blazing UI** – Tailwind CSS with glassmorphism and motion.
- **Smart caching** – per-route in-memory fetch cache keeps the UI snappy while preserving accuracy.
- **Retry-safe queuing** – every upstream call passes through a single serial queue with exponential back-off.
- **Code-split hooks** – each page imports only the data hooks it needs, trimming bundle size.

## Getting started 🛠️

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
